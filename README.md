# Pet Adoption Web App 

## Description
This project is a part of the Codecademy Front-End Engineer Course. Here, I learnt about React Router v6 and was tasked with the following:

1. The HomePage component responds to the browser’s current URL by displaying only pets of the species the user wishes to view.
2. The PetDetailsPage page displays when the browser’s current URL includes a specific pet’s id.
3. The PetDetailsPage displays data for the correct pet based on the id in the URL parameters’ values.
4. When the user searches for a pet in the search bar, they are redirected to the SearchPage, which uses the query parameter called name to filter pets by name.
5. When a user clicks a pet whose details are not available, they are redirected to a PetNotFoundPage.
6. From the PetNotFound page, users can click “Go Home” button that will take them to the root path page.

I was only supposed to 'fix' the routing issues; the rest of the code was provided for me.
